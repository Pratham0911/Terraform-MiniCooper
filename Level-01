Let's Start with Terraform!

Terraform is like magic for making big computer things happen. But before we dive into all the fun, let's learn some special words and what they mean.

Provider: A provider is like a special helper who knows how to talk to different places where we want to build stuff, like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft.

Resource: Imagine resources are like building blocks. Each block is something special we want to make, like a cool house, a shiny car, or a big tree.

Module: Modules are like special kits with instructions. They help us build things faster by putting together all the right blocks in the right order.

Configuration File: This is like a magic recipe book. It tells Terraform what we want to build, where we want to build it, and with what building blocks.

Variable: Variables are like blank spaces we fill in later. They help us make changes easily without rewriting everything.

Output: Outputs are like magic messages from Terraform. They tell us important things like where our house is, or how many trees we planted.

State File: This is like Terraform's memory. It remembers what we built and what changes we want to make next time.

Plan: A plan is like a sneak peek. It shows us what Terraform will build before it actually builds it.

Apply: Applying is like pressing the "Go" button. It tells Terraform to start building or changing things based on our plan.

Workspace: Workspaces are like secret rooms where we can build different things without messing up others. We can have a room for building toys, another for building houses, and so on.

Remote Backend: Think of a remote backend as a special safe place to keep our plans and memories. It's like putting our important stuff in a big vault for safekeeping.

These are the special words we use with Terraform. As we learn more and build cool things, we'll get even better at using them!
